## 📌 Overview

Crimson is an open-source component library for Ruby on Rails styled with TailwindCSS. As opposed to installing gems for different components, just copy and paste the files or code that you need! (But in the future, a gem install would be ideal 🙂) This project is largely focused on creating styled versions of components we really hate styling (i.e. login forms, signups, etc.)

## Contribution

If you love Rails and have experience styling with TailwindCSS I'd love your help. I'll always keep this repo free and open-source!
